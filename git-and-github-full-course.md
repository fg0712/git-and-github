# Comprehensive Git and GitHub Course

## Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and manage projects efficiently. GitHub is a platform built on top of Git that provides hosting for Git repositories, collaboration tools, and more. In this course, you’ll learn Git from scratch and how to use GitHub effectively.

### Prerequisites
- A computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Basic command-line knowledge (optional but helpful)
- A GitHub account (free tier is fine)

## 1. Installing Git

### Step 1: Download Git
- Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- Download the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Run the installer and follow the prompts. Default settings are usually fine for beginners.

### Step 2: Verify Installation
Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and type:
```bash
git --version
```
You should see something like `git version 2.43.0`. If not, reinstall Git.

## 2. Git Basics

### What is Version Control?
Version control systems (VCS) track changes to files over time. Git is a distributed VCS, meaning every user has a full copy of the repository, including its history.

### Configuring Git
Before using Git, set up your identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
- `--global` applies these settings to all Git projects on your machine.
- Check your config with:
```bash
git config --list
```

### Initializing a Repository
A repository (repo) is a directory where Git tracks changes.
1. Create a new folder:
```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```
2. Initialize Git:
```bash
git init
```
This creates a hidden `.git` folder that stores the repository’s data.

### Staging and Committing
Git uses a three-step workflow:
1. **Working Directory**: Your project files.
2. **Staging Area**: Files ready to be committed.
3. **Commit History**: Permanent snapshots of changes.

- Add a file (e.g., `index.html`):
```bash
echo "<h1>Hello Git</h1>" > index.html
```
- Stage the file:
```bash
git add index.html
```
- Commit the change:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
- `-m` specifies a commit message (keep it short and descriptive).

### Viewing History
- Check the status of your repo:
```bash
git status
```
- View commit history:
```bash
git log
```
- For a compact view:sdfghjkl;'tyuiopfghccfxfc
```bash
git log --oneline
```

## 3. Working with Branches

### Creating and Switching Branches
Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes independently.
- Create a new branch:
```bash
git branch feature-branch
```
- Switch to it:
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
```
- Or combine both steps:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```
- List all branches:
```bash
git branch
```

### Merging Branches
To combine changes from one branch into another:
1. Switch to the target branch (e.g., `main`):
```bash
git checkout main
```
2. Merge the feature branch:
```bash
git merge feature-branch
```
- If there are no conflicts, Git merges automatically.

### Handling Merge Conflicts
Conflicts occur when the same part of a file is changed differently in two branches.
1. Git will pause the merge and mark conflicts in the file:
```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>Main content</p>
=======
<p>Feature content</p>
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```
2. Edit the file to resolve the conflict, then:
```bash
git add <file>
git commit
```

---

## 4. Undoing Changes

### Unstaging Files
If you accidentally staged a file:
```bash
git restore --staged <file>
```

### Reverting Commits
To undo a commit but keep changes in the working directory:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```
Find the hash with `git log`.

### Resetting Changes
- Discard uncommitted changes:
```bash
git restore <file>
```
- Reset to a previous commit (careful, this rewrites history):
```bash
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

---

## 5. Introduction to GitHub

### Setting Up a GitHub Account
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up.
- Verify your email.

### Creating a Repository
1. Click “New” on GitHub’s homepage.
2. Name your repo (e.g., `my-project`).
3. Choose public or private, then click “Create repository.”

### Pushing to GitHub
1. Link your local repo to GitHub:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-project.git
```
2. Push your code:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
- `-u` sets the upstream branch for future pushes.

### Cloning and Forking
- **Clone**: Copy a repo to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/my-project.git
```
- **Fork**: Copy someone else’s repo to your GitHub account via the “Fork” button on GitHub.

---

## 6. Collaboration on GitHub

### Pull Requests
A pull request (PR) lets you propose changes to a repo.
1. Push a branch to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```
2. On GitHub, click “Compare & pull request.”
3. Add a description and submit.

### Issues and Project Boards
- **Issues**: Report bugs or suggest features via the “Issues” tab.
- **Project Boards**: Organize tasks using GitHub’s Kanban-style boards.

### Collaborating with Teams
- Add collaborators via the “Settings” tab in your repo.
- Use `@mentions` in issues/PRs to notify team members.

---

## 7. Advanced Git Concepts

### Rebasing
Rebasing rewrites history by moving your branch’s base:
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```
- Resolve conflicts if they arise, then:
```bash
git rebase --continue
```

### Stashing
Temporarily save uncommitted changes:
```bash
git stash
```
- Retrieve them later:
```bash
git stash pop
```

### Cherry-Picking
Apply a specific commit from one branch to another:
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Git Tags
Mark a specific commit (e.g., for releases):
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## 8. Best Practices
- Write clear, concise commit messages (e.g., “Fix login bug”).
- Commit often but logically (one change per commit).
- Use branches for features or fixes.
- Pull before pushing to avoid conflicts:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
- Keep your main branch stable.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting
- **“Detached HEAD”**: You’re not on a branch. Checkout a branch:
```bash
git checkout main
```
- **Merge conflicts**: Manually edit files and commit.
- **Push rejected**: Pull first, resolve conflicts, then push again.
